Posts App by Andre053

This react application is meant to showcase fundamental understanding of redux state while incorporating react componenets to create a small and functional application.

The app itself displays posts with authors, titles, and content. There is a form that allows you to add a post to this list, and the list is ordered based on upvotes, and then by id. 

Next steps include attaching the app to a Node backend and NoSQL database to hold the article JSON objects.
